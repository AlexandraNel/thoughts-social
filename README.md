## Description

**Motivation:** To create an API for a social network web application where users can share tehir thoughts, react to friends thoughts, and create a friends list.  

**The Why:** This project was executed in order to extend my skills in data mangement. Utilising Mongo DB and Mongoose ODM im order to organise a back end that can functionally manage user data in a social network setting 

**Problem Solved:** This project utilises an object based database to organise user interactions and allows them to publish thoughts and react to the thoughts of others. They can also connect to eachother via friendships 

**Lessons:** I learned new methods of routing, how to create models and schema for MongoDb, utilising Mongoose in an express application

## Technologies

- MongoDB
- ExpressJS
- Mongoose
- Javascript
- Dayjs
- Nodemon

## Installation

This is a back end only. 

1. npm i the required dependencies outlined in the package.js. 
2. Make sure you have nodemon, and start the server (alternatively npm run start) by running nodemon server. 
3. The server will initialise the seed data to seed your db. 

Please node- this is for dev environment and must be disabled on deployment. You can explore the routes and functionality of your routes in Insmonia

## Usage

This application can be connected to a front end. The front end will require FETCH requests to the back end. JSON objects are used to pass data from mongodb to the front end via mongoose. This can then be deployed.

## Roadmap

Front end needs to be created. Authentication is also not current- this is an important concern for not only security, but for the functioning of the user requests
